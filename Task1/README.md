# Responsive Landing Page

This project is a simple responsive landing page created as part of the Elevate Labs Web Development Internship task. The page includes a header with a logo and navigation links, a hero section with a heading, paragraph, and call-to-action button, and a footer with social links.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Flexbox for layout and media queries to ensure the page adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Semantic HTML**: Structured with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for accessibility and SEO.
- **Clean Styling**: Modern design with a dark header/footer and a light hero section, using a consistent color scheme.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive navigation links and call-to-action button with hover states.

- **VS Code**: Code editor with the live-server extension for real-time preview.
