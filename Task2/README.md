   └── (optional files)    # Screenshots, additional assets
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   
   **Option A: Using Live Server (Recommended)**
   - Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html`

   - Track total, completed, and pending tasks

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox, gradients, and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JS with ES6+ features

### Key JavaScript Concepts Demonstrated

1. **DOM Manipulation**
   ```javascript
   // Creating and modifying elements
   const li = document.createElement('li');
   li.classList.add('todo-item');
   ```

2. **Event Handling**
   ```javascript
   // Multiple event types
   this.addBtn.addEventListener('click', () => this.addTask());
   this.taskInput.addEventListener('keypress', (e) => {
       if (e.key === 'Enter') this.addTask();
   });
   ```

3. **State Management**
   ```javascript
   // Managing application state
   this.tasks = [];
   this.taskIdCounter = 1;
   ```

4. **Dynamic Content Updates**
   ```javascript
   // Real-time UI updates
   this.updateUI();
   this.renderTasks();
   this.updateStats();
   ```

### Architecture Pattern

The app uses a **Class-based Architecture** with the `TodoApp` class managing:
- State (tasks array)
- DOM interactions
- Event handling
- UI updates

## 🎨 Styling Features

- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Modern CSS gradients for visual appeal
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and keyframe animations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with media queries
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and visual feedback
- **Typography**: Clean, readable font hierarchy

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

By studying and building this project, you'll learn:

1. **DOM Manipulation**: How to create, modify, and remove HTML elements dynamically
2. **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions with various event types
3. **State Management**: Maintaining application data and ensuring UI consistency
4. **CSS Animations**: Creating engaging user interfaces with smooth transitions
5. **Responsive Design**: Building layouts that work across device sizes
6. **Code Organization**: Structuring JavaScript code with classes and methods
7. **User Experience**: Implementing intuitive interactions and visual feedback

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App doesn't load**
   - Ensure you're opening the HTML file in a web browser
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

2. **Styling looks broken**
   - Verify the HTML file contains the complete CSS in the `<style>` section
   - Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **Tasks not saving**
   - This app doesn't persist data between sessions (by design)
   - Tasks will reset when you refresh the page

4. **Mobile layout issues**
   - Ensure your browser supports modern CSS features
   - Try viewing on different mobile devices/browsers

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for advanced learning:
